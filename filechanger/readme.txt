Some image files imported from your mobile phone have filenames like 'IMG-20220101dsfsd,' which can be annoying to organize chronologically in a directory. 

This small app is meant to remove the 'IMG-' part. If your files are messed up in a different way, you can easily change the scanning logic to alter them accordingly.
